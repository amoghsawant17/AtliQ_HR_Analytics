# HR Analytics - Power BI

In this Data Analysis project, I have studied a dataset related to the HR department of a company. I have analyzed their employees' presence and leave data. 
And, I created a Power BI dashboard for Data Visualization.

## Problem statement

AtliQ company has an HR department that has real-time presence data of its employees. The senior management wants to gain actionable insights from this data. 
They want to make use of these insights for the collaborative and sustainable growth of their company.

## Project scope

This analysis and dashboard are very beneficial for the HR department as they can use this tool to track real-time employee data and make data-driven decisions.
The HR department can track various trends such as higher SL % and higher WFH % and share these insights with other departments which can be beneficial for manpower and workflow management.

## Problem Insights

- Presence % = Presence days/ Total working days and overall presence % is 91.8%.
- (Work From Home (WFH) % = WFH days/ Presence days) is 10% and (Sick Leave (SL %) = SL days/ Presence days) is 1.2%.
- The presence % is highest in April i.e., 94%, and lowest in May i.e., 89.7% all three months.
- SL % is lowest in April i.e., 0.5%, and highest in May i.e., 1.9% among all three months.
- WFH % is lowest in April i.e., 9.1%, and highest in May i.e., 11.2% among all three months.
- In a daily trend, the overall Presence % is higher on Mondays i.e., around 93%, and lower on Fridays i.e., around 90%.
- In a daily trend, overall WFH % is higher on Fridays i.e., 13%, and lower on Tuesdays i.e., around 8%.
- In a daily trend, overall SL % is higher on Mondays i.e., 1.7%, and lower on Fridays i.e., around 0.8%.
- There are 7 people who worked from home throughout these three months.
- There are 22 people who had a presence % of 100% and who did not take any leave in these three months.
- Ayanna Atkins took 6 SLs and had the highest overall SL% of 18% among its peers. Also, she had the second lowest overall presence of 58.9%.
- Gregory Carr had the lowest overall presence of 52.4% in these three months.
- Kaylah Schultz took 16 PLs and had the highest overall PL% of 41% among its peers.
- The overall sick leave count is 48 and the privilege leave count is 153 in these three months.

## Potential Decisions

#### Identify Trends and Patterns:
- Analyze the monthly trends to understand why presence percentages vary, especially the dip in May. This could help identify factors affecting attendance and address any issues.
- Examine the daily trends to understand patterns of absenteeism and remote work. This can help in scheduling and resource allocation.

#### Address Leave Patterns:
- Ayanna Atkins has a high sick leave percentage. Consider discussing her leave patterns, assessing her workload, and identifying any issues affecting her attendance and well-being.
- Understand the reasons behind Gregory Carr's low presence and address any potential concerns or challenges he might be facing.

#### Promote Work-Life Balance:
- Analyze the overall leave count and patterns to assess if employees are taking enough time off for rest and relaxation. Promote a healthy work-life balance to prevent burnout.

#### Encourage Remote Work:
- Given that WFH percentages vary, assess the reasons why some months have higher WFH percentages. Encourage remote work policies where applicable to improve overall employee satisfaction and productivity.

#### Recognition and Incentives:
- Acknowledge and appreciate the seven individuals who consistently worked from home. Consider recognizing their efforts and consider if there are ways to incentivize such behavior for the benefit of both employees and the organization.

#### Performance Management:
- Identify and celebrate the 22 employees with 100% presence. Consider recognizing their commitment and performance. This could also be used as a positive reinforcement strategy.

#### Leave Management:
- Keep an eye on leave counts, especially sick leave. If there is a significant increase in sick leave, it might be worth exploring the reasons behind it and addressing potential health and well-being concerns.

#### Training and Development:
- Identify areas where employees might need support or training to improve attendance, performance, or work-from-home effectiveness.

#### Employee Engagement:
- Use the insights to assess overall employee satisfaction and engagement. Consider conducting surveys or interviews to gather qualitative data about employee experiences.

#### Policy Review:
- Review existing policies on sick leave, work from home, and privilege leave. Ensure they align with the needs and expectations of the workforce. Make adjustments if necessary.
