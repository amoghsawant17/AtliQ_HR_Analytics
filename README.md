# AtliQ HR Analytics - PowerBI
In this Data Analysis project, I have studied a dataset related to the HR department of a company. I have analyzed their employees' presence and leave data. 
And, I created a PowerBI dashboard for Data Visualization.

## Problem statement
AtliQ company has an HR department that has real-time presence data of its employees. The senior management wants to gain actionable insights from this data. 
They want to make use of these insights for the collaborative and sustainable growth of their company.

## Project scope
This analysis and dashboard are very beneficial for the HR department as they can use this tool to track real-time employee data and make data-driven decisions.
The HR department can track various trends such as higher SL % and higher WFH % and share these insights with other departments which can be beneficial for manpower and workflow management.
